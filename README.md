🧠 Insights Derived from the Data

Hospital admissions increase steadily across the year, peaking in November and December.

The majority of patients were admitted for emergency care, showing heavy reliance on acute services.

A large portion of admissions came from Urban areas (73%), indicating geographic concentration.

Adults and Seniors represent the highest patient volume.

The average hospital stay is short (6 days), pointing toward efficient resource turnover.

ICU stay durations show most patients require fewer than 10 days, with limited long-term critical cases.
